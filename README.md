I have a sophisticated writing record and a presentation list. Winning two international travel awards and two local travel grants for two research papers and winning the Physical Science-Statistics award for the Honours thesis provide evidence regards to the quality of my work. I have been able to successfully deliver presentations at sixteen local and international conferences.
